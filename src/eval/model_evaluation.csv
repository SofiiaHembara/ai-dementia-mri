Learning Content Recommendation,"Topic/level and LO alignment","Precision@1, Recall@3, NDCG","P@1 ≥ 0.75; R@3 ≥ 0.90; NDCG ≥ 0.85","Gold-standard from anonymized Pearson courses; 2 independent reviewers; mapping to Pearson taxonomy","Map Program/Course → Module → LO; verify reading level (CEFR/Grade)"
Learning Content Recommendation,"Age/ethics & local cultural suitability","Policy-violation rate","≤ 0.3% per 1000 recs","Automated detectors + manual sample review","Check school levels, sensitive topics, local norms"
AI Tutor (Q&A),"Pedagogical correctness & step-by-step reasoning","Expert-rated Likert 1–5; Rubric pass rate","Avg ≥ 4.4; Rubric pass ≥ 0.9","Tutor QA set authored by Pearson teachers; double-blind review","Require hints first, solution next; compare against answer keys"
AI Tutor (Q&A),"Factual accuracy & citations","Fact-check pass rate; Citation presence","≥ 0.95; ≥ 90% answers with valid citations","Source checklist (Pearson refs/ISBN/chapter); manual validation on 300 answers","Minimize hallucinations; log sources/citations"
